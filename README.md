# Astray
Astray is an adventure/shooting/RPG game inspired by The Binding of Isaac and The Legend of Zelda (1986). You play as an astronaut astray on an alien planet abandoned by an ancient civilization, exploring a dark, alien-infested dungeon full of unexpected dangers. This project was developed as part of a training program for new members of USPGameDev, University of SÃ£o Paulo's game development studies and research student group.
Most of the assets used were taken from free and open sources, given the appropriate credit to all of the authors, but there is some original art as well, such as the astronaut sprites.
